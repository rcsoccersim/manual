If your client connects or reconnects sucessfully with a protocol version >= 7.0, the
server will additionally send following messages: ``server_param`` (a message
containing the server parameters), ``player_param`` (a message containing the
player parameters) and ``player_type`` (a message containing the player types).
Finally, the player will receive a message on changed
players (see Sec. :ref:`sec-heterogeneousplayers`).

==================================================
Sensor Models
==================================================

A RoboCup agent has three different sensors (and one special sensor).
The aural sensor detects messages sent by the referee, the coaches and the
other players.
The visual sensor detects visual information about the field, like the
distance and direction to objects in the player's current field of
view. The visual sensor also works as a proximity sensor by "seeing"
objects that are close, but behind the player.
The body sensor detects the current "physical" status of the player, like
its stamina, speed and neck angle.
Together the sensors give the agent quite a good picture of the environment.

--------------------------------------------------
Aural Sensor Model
--------------------------------------------------

Aural sensor messages are sent when a client or a coach sends a say command.
The calls from the referee is also received as aural messages.
All messages are received immediately.

The format of the aural sensor message from the soccer server is:

  (hear *Time* *Sender* ''*Message*'')

- *Time* indicates the current time.
- *Sender* is the relative direction to the sender if it is another player,
  otherwise it is one of the following:
   - ``self``: when the sender is yourself.
   - ``referee``: when the sender is the referee.
   - ``online_coach_left`` or ``online_coach_right``: when the sender is one of the online coaches.
- *Message* is the message. The maximum length is **server::say_msg_size** bytes.
  The possible messages from the referee are described in Section :ref:`sec-playmodes`.


The server parameters that affects the aural sensor are described in the
following table:


  Parameters for the aural sensor.
+-------------------------------------------+-----------+
|Parameter in server.conf                   |Value      |
+===========================================+===========+
|autio_cut_dist                             |50.0       |
+-------------------------------------------+-----------+
|hear_max                                   |1          |
+-------------------------------------------+-----------+
|hear_inc                                   |1          |
+-------------------------------------------+-----------+
|hear_decay                                 |1          |
+-------------------------------------------+-----------+


^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Capacity of the Aural Sensor
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


A player can only hear a message if the player's hear capacity is at least
**server::hear_decay**, since the hear capacity of the player is decreased by
that number when a message is heard.
Every cycle the hear capacity is increased with **server::hear_inc**.
The maximum hear capacity is **server::hear_max**.
To avoid a team from making the other team's communication useless by
overloading the channel the players have separate hear capacities for each team.
With the current server.conf file this means that a player can hear at most
one message from each team every second simulation cycle.

If more messages arrive at the same time than the player can hear the messages
actually heard are chosen randomly.
.. (The current implementation choose the messages according to the order of arrival.)
This rule does not include messages from the referee, or messages from oneself.
.. In other words, a player can say a message and hear a message from another
.. player in the same timestep.


^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Range of Communication
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A message said by a player is transmitted only to players within
**server::audio_cut_dist** meters from that player.
For example, a defender, who may be near his own goal, can hear a message
from his goal-keeper but a striker who is near the opponent goal can not hear
the message.
Messages from the referee can be heard by all players.


^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Aural Sensor Example
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This example should show which messages get through and how to calculated
the hear capacity.

Example:
Each coach sends a message every cycle.
The referee send a message every cycle.
The four players in the example all send a message every cycle.
Show which messages gets through during 10 cycles (6 might be enough).


.. _sec-visionsensor:

--------------------------------------------------
Vision Sensor Model
--------------------------------------------------


The visual sensor reports the objects currently seen by the player.
The information is automatically sent to the player every
**server::sense_step**, currently 150, milli-seconds, in the default setting.

Visual information arrives from the server in the following basic format:

  (see *ObjName* *Distance* *Direction* *DistChng* *DirChng* *BodyDir* *HeadDir*)

*Distance*, *Direction*, *DistChng* and *DirChng* are calculated in the
following way:


.. math::

  p_{rx} &= p_{xt} - p_{xo} \\
  p_{ry} &= p_{yt} - p_{yo} \\
  v_{rx} &= v_{xt} - v_{xo} \\
  v_{ry} &= v_{yt} - v_{yo} \\
  Distance &= \sqrt{p_{rx}^2 + p_{ry}^2} \\
  Direction &= \arctan{(p_{ry}/p_{rx})} - a_o \\
  e_{rx} &= p_{rx} / Distance \\
  e_{ry} & = p_{ry} / Distance \\
  DistChng &= (v_{rx} * e_{rx}) + (v_{ry} * e_{ry}) \\
  DirChng &= [(-(v_{rx} * e_{ry}) + (v_{ry} * e_{rx})) / Distance] * (180 / \pi)  \\
  BodyDir &= PlayerBodyDir - AgentBodyDir - AgentHeadDir \\
  HeadDir &= PlayerHeadDir - AgentBodyDir - AgentHeadDir


where :math:`(p_{xt},p_{yt}) is the absolute position of the target object,
:math:`(p_{xo},p_{yo})` is the absolute position of the sensing player,
:math:`(v_{xt},v_{yt})` is the absolute velocity of the target object,
:math:`(v_{xo},v_{yo})` is the absolute velocity of the sensing player,
and :math:`a_o` is the absolute direction the sensing player is facing.
The absolute facing direction of a player is the sum of the *BodyDir* and
the *HeadDir* of that player.
In addition to it, :math:`(p_{rx},p_{ry})` and :math:`(v_{rx},v_{ry})` are
respectively the relative position and the relative velocity of the target,
and :math:`(e_{rx},e_{ry})` is the unit vector that is parallel to the vector
of the relative position.
*BodyDir* and *HeadDir* are only included if the observed object is a player,
and is the body and head directions of the observed player relative to the body
and head directions of the observing player.
Thus, if both players have their bodies turned in the same direction, then
*BodyDir* would be 0.  The same goes for *HeadDir*.

The **(goal r)** object is interpreted as the center of the right hand side
goalline.
**(f c)** is a virtual flag at the center of the field.
**(f l b)** is the flag at the lower left of the field.
**(f p l b)** is a virtual flag at the lower right corner of the penalty box
on the left side of the field.
**(f g l b)** is a virtual flag marking the right goalpost on the left goal.
The remaining types of flags are all located 5 meters outside the playing
field. For example, **(f t l 20)** is 5 meters from the top sideline and 20
meters left from the center line.
In the same way, **(f r b 10)** is 5 meters right of the right sideline and
10 meters below the center of the right goal.
Also, **(f b 0)** is 5 meters below the midpoint of the bottom sideline.

In the case of **(l ...)**, *Distance* is the distance to the point where
the center line of the player's view crosses the line, and *Direction* is
the direction of the line.

Currently there are 55 flags (the goals counts as flags) and 4 lines to be
seen. All of the flags and lines are shown in Fig. :ref:`field-detailed`.

  The flags and lines in the simulation.


^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Range of View
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The visible sector of a player is dependant on several factors.
First of all we have the server parameters **server::sense_step** and
**server::visible_angle** which determines the basic time step between
visual information and how many degrees the player's normal view cone is.
The current default values are 150 milli-seconds and 90 degrees.

The player can also influence the frequency and quality of the information
by changing *ViewWidth* and *ViewQuality*.

To calculate the current view frequency and view angle of the agent
use equations :ref:`eq:view-freq` and :ref:`eq:view-angle`.

.. math::
  :label: eq:view-freq

  view\_frequency = sense\_step * view\_quality\_factor * view\_width\_factor

where view_quality_factor is 1 if *ViewQuality* is ``high``
and 0.5 if *ViewQuality* is ``low``;
view_width_factor is 2 if *ViewWidth* is ``narrow``,
1 if *ViewWidth* is ``normal``, and 0.5 if *ViewWidth* is ``wide``.

.. math::
  :label: eq:view-angle

  view\_angle = visible\_angle * view\_width\_factor

where view_width_factor is 0.5 if *ViewWidth* is ``narrow``,
1 if *ViewWidth* is ``normal``, and 2 if *ViewWidth* is ``wide``.

The player can also "see" an object if it's within **server::visible_distance**
meters of the player.
If the objects is within this distance but not in the view cone then the
player can know only the type of the object (ball, player, goal or flag),
but not the exact name of the object.
Moreover, in this case, the capitalized name, that is "B", "P", "G" and "F",
is used as the name of the object rather than "b", "p", "g" and "f".

.. figure:: ./images/view-example.*
  :align: center
  :name: view-example

  The visible range of an individual agent in the soccer server.
  The viewing agent is the one shown as two semi-circles. The light
  semi-circle is its front. The black circles represent objects in the world.
  Only objects within **server::view_angle**/2, and those within
  **server::visible_distance** of the viewing agent can be seen.
  **unum_far_length**, **unum_too_far_length**, **team_far_length**, and
  **team_too_far_length** affect the amount of precision
  with which a players’ identity is given. Taken from [Stone98]_.


The following example and Fig.:ref:`view-example` are taken from [Stone98]_.

The meaning of the view_angle parameter is illustrated in Fig.:ref:`view-example`.
In this figure, the viewing agent is the one shown as two semi-circles.
The light semi-circle is its front.
The black circles represent objects in the world.
Only objects within :math:`view\_angle^\circ/2`, and those within
visible_distance of the viewing agent can be seen.
Thus, objects *b* and *g* are not visible; all of the rest are.

As object *f* is directly in front of the viewing agent, its angle would be
reported as 0 degrees.
Object *e* would be reported as being roughly :math:`-40^\circ`, while object
*d* is at roughly :math:`20^\circ.

Also illustrated in Fig.:ref:`view-example`, the amount of information
describing a player varies with how far away the player is.
For nearby players, both the team and the uniform number of the player are
reported.
However, as distance increases, first the likelihood that the uniform number
is visible decreases, and then even the team name may not be visible.
It is assumed in the server that **unum_far_length** :math:`\leq`
**unum_too_far_length** :math:`\leq` **team_far_length** :math:`\leq`
**team_too_far_length**.
Let the player's distance be *dist*. Then

- If *dist* :math:`\leq` **unum_far_length**, then both uniform number and
  team name are visible.
- If **unum_far_length** :math:`<` *dist* :math:`<` **unum_too_far_length**,
  then the team name is always visible, but the probability that the uniform
  number is visible decreases linearly from 1 to 0 as *dist* increases.
- If *dist* :math:`\geq` **unum_too_far_length**, then the uniform number is
  not visible.
- If *dist* :math`\leq` **team_far_length**, then the team name is visible.
- If **team_far_length** :math:`<` *dist* :math:`<` **team_too_far_length**,
  then the probability that the team name is visible decreases linearly from 1
  to 0 as *dist* increases.
- If *dist* :math:`\geq` **team_too_far_length**, then the team name is not
  visible.

For example, in Fig.:ref:`view-example`, assume that all of the labeled circles
are players.
Then player *c* would be identified by both team name and uniform number;
player *d* by team name, and with about a 50% chance, uniform number;
player *e* with about a 25% chance, just by team name, otherwise with neither;
and player *f* would be identified simply as an anonymous player.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Visual Sensor Noise Model
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In order to introduce noise in the visual sensor data the values sent from
the server is quantized.
For example, the distance value of the object, in the case where the object
in sight is a ball or a player, is quantized in the following manner:

.. math::

  d' = {\rm Quantize}(\exp({\rm Quantize}(\log(d),quantize\_step)),0.1)


where :math:`d` and :math:`d'` are the exact distance and quantized distance
respectively, and

.. math::

  {\rm Quantize}(V,Q) = {\rm ceiling}(V/Q) \cdot Q


This means that players can not know the exact positions of very far objects.
For example, when distance is about 100.0 the maximum noise is about 10.0,
while when distance is less than 10.0 the noise is less than 1.0.

In the case of flags and lines, the distance value is quantized in the
following manner.

.. math::

  d' = {\rm Quantize}(\exp({\rm Quantize}(\log(d),quantize\_step\_l)),0.1)


--------------------------------------------------
Body Sensor Model
--------------------------------------------------

The body sensor reports the current "physical" status of the
player.
he information is automatically sent to the player every
**server::sense_body_step**, currently 100,  milli-seconds.

The format of the body sensor message is:

+-------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

|             | | (foul (charged *FoulCycles*) (card {red\|yellow\|none})))                             |
+-------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

- *ViewQuality* is one of ``high`` and ``low``.
- *ViewWidth* is one of ``narrow``, ``normal``, and ``wide``.
- *AmountOfSpeed* is an approximation of the amount of the player's speed.
- *DirectionOfSpeed* is an approximation of the direction of the player's speed.
- *HeadDirection* is the relative direction of the player's head.
- *\*Count* variables are the total number of commands of that type
  executed by the server.  For example *DashCount* = 134 means
  that the player has executed 134 **dash** commands so far.
- *MovableCycles*
- *ExpireCycles*
- *FoulCycles*

The semantics of the parameters are described where they are actually
used.
he *ViewQuality* and *ViewWidth* parameters are for example described
in the Section :ref:`sec-visionsensor`.


The server parameters that affects the body sensor are described in
the following table:

 Parameters for the body sensors.

+---------------------------------------+-----------+



==================================================
Movement Models
==================================================

In each simulation step, movement of each object is calculated as following manner:

.. math::
  :label: eq:u-t

   (u_x^{t+1},u_y^{t+1}) &= (v_x^t,v_y^t)+(a_x^t,a_y^t) : accelerate \\
   (p_x^{t+1},p_y^{t+1}) &= (p_x^t,p_y^t)+(u_x^{t+1},u_y^{t+1}) : move \\
   (v_x^{t+1},v_y^{t+1}) &= decay \times (u_x^{t+1},u_y^{t+1}) : decay\ speed \\
   (a_x^{t+1},a_y^{t+1}) &= (0,0) : reset\ acceleration

where, :math:`(p_x^t,p_y^t)`, and :math:`(v_x^t,v_y^t)` are respectively position
and velocity of the object in timestep :math:`t`. decay is a decay parameter
specified by ``ball_decay`` or ``player_decay``. :math:`(a_x^t,a_y^t)` is
acceleration of object, which is derived from Power parameter in ``dash``
(in the case the object is a player) or ``kick`` (in the case of a ball)
commands in the following manner:

.. math::
  (a_x^{t},a_y^{t}) = Power \times power\_rate \times (\cos(\theta^t),\sin(\theta^t))

where :math:`\theta^t` is the direction of the object in timestep :math:`t` and
power_rate is ``dash_power_rate`` or is calculated from ``kick_power_rate``
as described in Sec. :ref:`sec-kickmodel`.
In the case of a player, this is just the direction the player is facing.
In the case of a ball, its direction is given as the following manner:

.. math::

  \theta^t_{ball} = \theta^t_{kicker} + Direction

where :math:`\theta^t_{ball}` and :math:`\theta^t_{kicker}` are directions of
ball and kicking player respectively, and *Direction* is the second parameter
of a **kick** command.


--------------------------------------------------
Movement Noise Model
--------------------------------------------------

In order to reflect unexpected movements of objects in real world,
rcssserver adds noise to the movement of objects and parameters of commands.

Concerned with movements,
noise is added into Eqn.:ref:`eq:u-t` as follows:

.. math::

  (u_x^{t+1},u_y^{t+1}) = (v_x^{t}, v_y^{t}) + (a_x^{t}, a_y^{t}) + (\tilde{r}_{\rm rmax},\tilde{r}_{\rm rmax})

where :math:`\tilde{r}_{\rm rmax}` is a random number whose distribution
is uniform over the range :math:`[-{\rm rmax},{\rm rmax}]`.
:math:`{\rm rmax}` is a parameter that depends on amount of velocity
of the object as follows:

.. math::

  {\rm rmax} = {\rm rand} \cdot |(v_x^{t}, v_y^{t})|

where :math:`{\rm rand}` is a parameter specified by **server::player_rand**
or **server::ball_rand**.

Noise is added also into the *Power* and *Moment* arguments of a
command as follows:

.. math::

  argument = (1 + \tilde{r}_{\rm rand}) \cdot argument



--------------------------------------------------
Collision Model
--------------------------------------------------

If at the end of the simulation cycle, two objects overlap, then the
objects are moved back until they do not overlap.
Then the velocities are multiplied by -0.1.
Note that it is possible for the ball to go through a player as long
as the ball and the player never overlap at the end of the cycle.


==================================================
Action Models
==================================================

--------------------------------------------------
Catch Model
--------------------------------------------------

.. figure:: ./images/catcharea.*
  :align: center
  :name: catcharea

  Catchable area of the goalie when doing a (catch 45)

The goalie is the only player with the ability to catch a ball. The
goalie can catch the ball in play mode ``play_on`` in any direction,
if the ball is within the catchable area and the goalie is inside the
penalty area.  If the goalie catches into direction :math:`\varphi`,
the catchable area is a rectangular area of length
**server::catchable_area_l** and width **server::catchable_area_w** in
direction :math:`\varphi` (see Fig.:ref:`catcharea`).
The ball will be caught with probability
**server::catch_probability**, if it is inside this area (and it will
not be caught if it is outside this area).
For the current values of catch command parameters see
the following table:


 Parameters for the goalie catch command

+-------------------------------------------------+-----------+
|Parameter in ``server.conf`` and ``player.conf`` |Value      |
+=================================================+===========+
|server::catchable_area_l                         |2.0        |

+-------------------------------------------------+-----------+


**TODO** about heterogenous parameters.




If a catch command was unsuccessful, it takes
**server::catch_ban_cycle** cycles until another catch command can be
used (catch commands during this time have simply no effect).
If the goalie succeeded in catching the ball, the play mode will
change to ``goalie_catch_ball_[l|r]`` first and ``free_kick_[l|r]``,
after that during the same cycle.
nce the goalie caught the ball, it can use the **move** command to
move with the ball inside the penalty area.
he goalie can use the **move** command **server::goalie_max_moves**
times before it kicks the ball.
dditional **move** commands do not have any effect and the server will
respond with ``(error too_many_moves)``.
Please note that catching the ball, moving around, kicking the ball a
short distance and immediately catching it again to move more than
**server::goalie_max_moves** times is considered as ungentlemanly
play.


--------------------------------------------------
Dash Model
--------------------------------------------------


The **dash** command is used to accelerate the player in direction of
its body.
**dash** takes the acceleration *power* as a parameter.
The valid range for the acceleration *power* can be configured in
``server.conf``, the respective parameters are **server::min_dash_power**
and **server::max_dash_power**.
For the current values of parameters for the dash model, see
the following list:

Each player has a certain amount of stamina that will be consumed by
**dash** commands.
At the beginning of each half, the stamina of a player is set to
**server::stamina_max**.
If a player accelerates forward (*power* :math:`> 0`), stamina is
reduced by *power*.
Accelerating backwards (*power* :math:`< 0`) is more expensive for the
player: stamina is reduced by :math:`-2~\cdot~`*power*.
If the player's stamina is lower than the power needed for the
**dash**, *power* is reduced so that the **dash** command does not
need more stamina than available.
Some extra stamina can be used every time the available power is lower
than the needed stamina.
The amount of extra stamina depends on the player type and the
parameters **player::extra_stamina_delta_min** and
player::extra_stamina_delta_max**.

After reducing the stamina, the server calculates the *effective  dash
power* for the **dash** command.
The effective dash power *edp* depends on the **dash_power_rate** and the
current effort of the player.
The effort of a player is a value between **effort_min** and **effort_max**;
it is dependent on the stamina management of the player (see below).

.. math::
  :label: eq:effectivedash

  {\rm edp} = {\rm effort} \cdot {\rm dash_power_rate} \cdot {\rm power}

*edp* and the players current body direction are tranformed into vector and
added to the players current acceleration vector :math:`\vec{a}_n`
(usually, that should be 0 before, since a player cannot dash more than once
a cycle and a player does not get accelerated by other means than dashing).

At the transition from simulation step $n$ to simulation step
:math:`n + 1$, acceleration :math:`\vec{a}_n` is applied:

1. :math:`\vec{a}_n` is normalized to a maximum length of **server::player_accel_max**.
2. :math:`\vec{a}_n` is added to current players speed
   :math:`\vec{v}_n`. :math:`\vec{v}_n` will be normalized to a
   maximum length of **player_speed_max**.
   players, the  maximum speed is a value between
   **server::player_speed_max** +
   **player::player_speed_max_delta_min** and
   **server::player_speed_max** +
   **player::player_speed_max_delta_max** in ``player.conf``.
3. Noise :math:`\vec{n}` and wind :math:`\vec{w}` will be added to
   :math:`\vec{v}_{n}`. Both noise and wind are configurable in
   `server.conf`. Parameters responsible for the wind are
   **server::wind_force**, **server::wind_dir** and
   **server::wind_rand**. With the current settings, there is no wind
   on the simulated soccer field. The responsible parameter for the
   noise is **server::player_rand**. Both direction and length
   of the noise vector are within the interval
   :math:`[ -|\vec{v}_{n}| \cdot {\rm player\_rand} \ldots |\vec{v}_{n}| \cdot {\rm player\_rand}]`.
4. The new position of the player :math:`\vec{p}_{n+1}` is the old position
   :math:`\vec{p}_{n}` plus the velocity vector :math:`\vec{v}_{n}`
   (i.e.\ the maximum distance difference for the player between two
   simulation steps is **player_speed_max).
5. **player_decay** is applied for the velocity of the player:
   :math:`\vec{v}_{n+1} = \vec{v}_{n} \cdot {\rm player\_decay}`.
   Acceleration :math:`\vec{a}_{n+1}` is set to zero.

Stamina Model
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For the stamina of a player, there are three important variables: the
*stamina* value, *recovery* and *effort*.
*stamina* is decreased when dashing and gets replenished slightly each
cycle. *recovery* is responsible for how much the *stamina* recovers
each cycle, and the *effort* says how effective dashing is (see
section above).
Important parameters for the stamina model are changeable in the files
``server.conf`` and ``player.conf``.
Basically, the algorithm shown in the following code block says that
every simulation step the stamina is below some threshold, effort or
recovery are reduced until a minimum is reached.
Every step the stamina of the player is above some threshold, *effort*
is increased up to a maximum.
The *recovery* value is only reset to 1.0 each half, but it will not
be increased during a game.

::

    # if stamina is below recovery decrement threshold, recovery is reduced
    if stamina <= recover_dec_thr * stamina_max
      if recovery > recover_min
         recovery = recovery - recover_dec

    # if stamina is below effort decrement threshold, effort is reduced
    if stamina <= effort_dec_thr * stamina_max
      if effort > effort_min
        effort = effort - effort_dec
	  effort = max(effort, effort_min)

    # if stamina is above effort increment threshold, effort is increased
    if stamina >= effort_inc_thr * stamina\_max
      if effort < effort_max
        effort = effort + effort_inc
        effort = min(effort, effort_max)

    # recover the stamina a bit
    stamina = stamina + recovery * stamina_inc_max
    stamina = min(stamina, stamina_max)


.. _sec-kickmodel:

--------------------------------------------------
Kick Model
--------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------
Move Model
--------------------------------------------------

The *move command* can be used to place a player directly onto a desired position on the field. move exists to set up the team and does not work during normal play. It is available at the beginning of each half (play mode ‘**before_kick_off**’) and after a goal has been scored (play modes ‘**goal_r_n **’ or ‘**goal_l_n** ’). In these situations, players can be placed on any position in their own half (i.e. X < 0) and can be moved any number of times, as long as the play mode does not change. Players moved to a position on the opponent half will be set to a random position on their own side by the server.
A second purpose of the *move command* is to move the goalie within the penalty area after the goalie caught the ball. If the goalie caught the ball, it can move together with the ball within the penalty area. The goalie is allowed to move *goalie_max_moves* times before it kicks the ball. Additional *move commands* do not have any effect and the server will respond with (error too_many_moves).


                 Parameter for the move_command 
+-------------------------------------------------+-----------+
|Parameter in ``server.conf``                     | Value     |

+-------------------------------------------------+-----------+


--------------------------------------------------
Say Model
--------------------------------------------------

Using the *say command*, players can broadcast messages to other players. Messages can be say_msg_size characters long, where valid characters for say messages are from the set sth (without the square brackets). Messages players say can be heard within a distance of *audio_cut_dist* by members of both teams . **Say messages** sent to the server will be sent back to players within that distance immediately. The use of the *say command* is only restricted by the limited capacity of the players of hearing messages.

Tackle Model
--------------------------------------------------


--------------------------------------------------
Turn Model
--------------------------------------------------

While *dash* is used to accelerate the player in direction of its body, the *turn command* is used to change the players body direction. The argument for the turn command is the moment; valid values for the moment are between **minmoment** and **maxmoment**. If the player does not move, the moment is equal to the angle the player will turn. However, there is a concept of inertia that makes it more difficult to turn when you are moving. Specifically, the actual angle the player is turned is as follows:
**actual_angle = moment/(1.0 + inertia_moment · player_speed)** (4.22)
*Inertia_moment* is a server.conf parameter with default value 5.0. Therefore (with default values), when the player is at speed 1.0, the *maximum effective* turn he can do is ±30. However, notice that because you can not dash and turn during the same cycle, the fastest that a player can be going when executing a turn is *player_speed_max* · player decay, which means the effective turn for a default player (with default values) is ±60.
For heterogeneous players, the inertia moment is the default inertia value plus a value between min. *player_decay_delta_min* · *inertia_moment_delta_factor and max*. *player_decay_delta_max* · *inertia_moment_delta_factor*.

+---------------------+------------+--------------------------------+-------+-------+




--------------------------------------------------
TurnNeck Model
--------------------------------------------------

With *turn_neck*, a player can turn its neck somewhat independently of its body. The angle of the head of the player is the viewing angle of the player. The *turn command* changes the angle of the body of the player while turn_neck changes the neck angle of the player relative to its body. The **minimum** and **maximum** relative angle for the player’s neck are given by **minmoment** and **maxmoment** in server.conf. Remember that the neck angle is relative to the body of the player so if the client issues a *turn command*, the viewing angle changes even if no turn_neck command was issued.
Also, *turn_neck commands* can be executed during the same cycle as turn, dash, and *kick commands*. turn_neck is not affected by momentum like turn is. The argument for a *turn_neck command* must be in the range between **minneckmoment** and **maxneckmoment**.


                Parameter for the turn neck command

|minneckmoment                                    | -180      |
